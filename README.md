ABOUT 
-----
This is a sample code to upload a directory in your local machine to the AWS S3 storage. Only files in the directory are uploaded and not the subdirectories.For this code to work you need to configure 3 things.
1. Bucket Name
2. Access Key
3. Security Key

Once done this code should run without any issues. I have also added the AWS .NET SDK wrapper along with the project as binary.
